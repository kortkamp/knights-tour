# Knight's Tour Solver

Simple Vanilla JS app developed to show Knight's Tour problem solving process.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.Trying to find such sequence only by brute force is not a good idea, for example, there are approximately 4×10^51 possible move sequences on an 8 × 8 board.

In my project we can choose one or more strategies to search for a knight's tour solution and graphically see the process, what is a cool feature in exchange for some performance. Of course the project was built just for didactic purposes and do not intent to be more performant than the necessary.
